   - Threat modeling for significant architecture changes
   - Post-release validation testing

2. **Infrastructure Changes**
   - Security review when changing cloud providers or services
   - Validation of new infrastructure components
   - Privilege and access control reviews after restructuring

3. **Security Incidents**
   - Post-incident comprehensive security review
   - Gap analysis to identify missed controls
   - Implementation verification of remediation measures

4. **Compliance Requirement Changes**
   - Review when relevant standards or regulations change
   - Gap analysis against new requirements
   - Implementation planning for new compliance controls

## Security Testing Methodology

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**Tools:**
- ESLint Security Plugin for JavaScript/TypeScript
- SonarQube for general code quality and security issues
- Semgrep for custom rule development
- GitHub CodeQL for advanced semantic analysis

**Process:**
1. Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
2. Run on each pull request
3. Base severity on CVSS scoring
4. Block merges for critical or high findings
5. Review medium findings during sprint
6. Document and track low findings for future refactoring

**Implementation Example:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow excerpt
security-scan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: SonarQube Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@master
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
    - name: ESLint Security
      run: npx eslint --config .eslintrc.security.js .
    - name: Semgrep
      uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
```

### Dependency Scanning

**Tools:**
- npm audit for JavaScript dependencies
- Snyk for comprehensive dependency tracking
- OWASP Dependency-Check for broader language support
- GitHub Dependabot for automated alerts and PRs

**Process:**
1. Daily automated scanning of all dependencies
2. Immediate alerts for critical vulnerabilities
3. Weekly review of medium/high vulnerabilities
4. Automated pull requests for safe updates
5. Manual review of breaking changes
6. Documentation of accepted risks where updates aren't feasible

**Implementation Example:**
```json
// package.json excerpt
{
  "scripts": {
    "security:audit": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
    "security:snyk": "snyk test",
    "precommit": "npm run security:audit"
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

**Tools:**
- OWASP ZAP for API and web interface scanning
- Burp Suite Professional for manual testing
- Custom scripts for business logic testing
- Postman security testing collections

**Process:**
1. Weekly automated baseline scans
2. Monthly deep scans with authenticated sessions
3. Quarterly manual testing of complex workflows
4. API fuzzing for endpoint robustness
5. Application logic testing for authorization bypasses

**Implementation Example:**
```yaml
# CI pipeline excerpt
dast-testing:
  stage: security
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://${DEPLOY_URL} -c gen.conf
  only:
    - main
    - staging
```

### Penetration Testing

**Approach:**
- Combination of internal and external testing
- Grey-box methodology (partial information provided)
- Focus on real-world attack scenarios
- Testing of both technical and social engineering vectors

**Schedule:**
- Annual comprehensive external penetration test
- Quarterly internal penetration testing
- Ad-hoc testing after major architecture changes
- Bug bounty program for continuous external feedback

**Scope:**
1. API security testing
2. Frontend application security
3. Infrastructure security
4. Authentication and authorization mechanisms
5. Business logic vulnerabilities
6. Data validation and sanitization
7. Encryption implementation

### Infrastructure Security Assessment

**Tools:**
- Terraform security scanners (tfsec, Checkov)
- Azure Security Center monitoring
- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools
- Container scanning with Trivy or Clair

**Process:**
1. Scan all infrastructure as code before deployment
2. Regular compliance checks against benchmarks (CIS)
3. Network security configuration validation
4. Identity and access management reviews
5. Storage security and encryption validation

**Implementation Example:**
```yaml
# Pre-deployment check
infrastructure-security:
  script:
    - terraform init
    - terraform plan -out=tfplan
    - terraform show -json tfplan > plan.json
    - checkov -f plan.json
    - tfsec .
  only:
    - infrastructure/*
```
