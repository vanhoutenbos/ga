# Azure Functions Performance Testing Strategy

This document outlines our approach to performance testing Azure Functions in the Golf Tournament Organizer application, with particular focus on high-load scenarios during tournaments.

## Performance Testing Goals

Our performance testing for Azure Functions aims to:

1. Validate that functions meet response time SLAs under various loads
2. Identify bottlenecks in function execution and data access patterns
3. Determine appropriate scaling configurations for different usage patterns
4. Ensure cost efficiency in high-load periods
5. Verify that performance remains consistent with increasing tournament participation

## Key Performance Scenarios

### Tournament Day Load Testing

During tournament days, we expect specific usage patterns with concentrated load:

- **Tournament Check-in**: 100-200 concurrent users registering presence within 30-60 minute window
- **Score Submission**: 50-100 concurrent score card submissions every 10-15 minutes
- **Leaderboard Access**: 500+ concurrent users refreshing leaderboard data, especially near tournament completion
- **Live Scoring**: Real-time score updates requiring efficient function execution and Supabase integration

### Testing Tools and Technologies

1. **Azure Load Testing**: Primary tool for realistic load simulation with metrics integration
2. **JMeter**: For specialized test scenarios and local testing during development
3. **Application Insights**: For detailed performance telemetry and bottleneck identification
4. **Azure Functions Monitor**: For consumption metrics and execution statistics

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Load Profile Definition

We define test scenarios based on actual user behavior patterns:

- **Steady Load**: Consistent request rate over extended periods
- **Spike Load**: Sudden surges in requests (e.g., leaderboard during final holes)
- **Ramp-up Load**: Gradually increasing load to identify breaking points
- **Endurance Tests**: Extended duration testing to detect memory leaks or performance degradation

### 2. Test Environment

- Testing performed in isolated staging environment with production-equivalent configuration
- Database seeded with realistic tournament data volumes
- All integrations (Supabase, Storage, etc.) properly configured for testing

### 3. Key Metrics

We track the following key metrics:

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| P95 Response Time | < 800ms | > 2000ms |
| P99 Response Time | < 1500ms | > 3000ms |
| Cold Start Frequency | < 5% | > 10% |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | > 1% |
| Function Execution Units | < 80% of plan | > 95% of plan |
| Memory Usage | < 75% of allocation | > 90% of allocation |

### 4. Function-Specific Test Cases

#### Tournament Management Functions

- Creating tournaments with various player counts (10, 50, 100, 200+)
- Updating tournament details and structures
- Processing tournament completions and results calculations

#### Scoring Functions

- Concurrent score submission handling
- Score validation and calculation performance
- Leaderboard calculation with various tournament sizes

#### Real-time Update Functions

- Performance under high subscription counts
- Message throughput for live scoring updates
- Notification dispatching for various recipient counts

## Performance Optimization Techniques

Based on our testing, we implement these optimization techniques:

1. **Consumption Plan Optimization**:
   - Function bindings optimized to reduce execution time
   - Appropriate memory allocation for compute-intensive functions

2. **Premium Plan Features** (for critical tournament-day functions):
   - Pre-warmed instances to eliminate cold starts
   - Instance-based scaling rules for predictable tournament days

3. **Data Access Patterns**:
   - Strategic caching of tournament data
   - Batched database operations for score processing
   - Optimized queries with appropriate indexing

4. **Function Isolation**:
   - High-load functions isolated to dedicated plans
   - Background processing separated from user-facing functions

## Scaling Strategy

Our Azure Functions scale according to these patterns:

1. **Automatic Scaling**:
   - Default for most functions with consumption plan
   - Monitored for cost efficiency and throttling events

2. **Pre-scaled Instances**:
   - For known tournament days
   - Scaled up 1 hour before tournament start times
   - Gradually scaled down after tournament completion

3. **Durable Functions**:
   - For long-running operations like tournament results processing
   - Configured with appropriate timeout and retry policies

## Monitoring During Load Tests

During load tests, we actively monitor:

1. Application Insights live metrics
2. Azure Functions execution statistics
3. Database performance metrics
4. Supabase API response times and throttling
5. End-to-end transaction times for critical user journeys

## Testing Frequency and Triggers

1. **Scheduled Tests**:
   - Basic performance test suite runs weekly
   - Comprehensive load tests run monthly
   - Full-scale tournament simulation quarterly

2. **Change-Triggered Tests**:
   - Major architectural changes
   - Database schema updates
   - Function app version upgrades
   - New feature deployments affecting critical paths

## Integration with CI/CD

Performance testing is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline:

1. Basic performance checks in PR validation
2. Acceptance criteria includes performance thresholds
3. Automated performance regression detection
4. Load test results feeding into release approval process

## Reporting and Analysis

Performance test results are:

1. Documented in Azure DevOps test runs
2. Analyzed for trends over time
3. Compared against baseline metrics
4. Used to generate optimization recommendations
5. Shared with development team in sprint reviews

## Disaster Recovery Testing

As part of our performance testing, we simulate failure scenarios:

1. Function app restarts during high load
2. Database failovers under transaction pressure
3. Region failover procedures for critical functions
4. Cold start impact assessment after deployment

## Conclusion

This performance testing approach ensures our Azure Functions can handle expected tournament loads while maintaining responsiveness and user experience quality. By systematically testing and optimizing our functions, we can confidently support tournaments of increasing scale while managing costs effectively.
