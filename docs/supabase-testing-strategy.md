# Supabase Testing Strategy

This document outlines our approach to testing Supabase integration, with a particular focus on Row-Level Security (RLS) policies and real-time features. Since we're utilizing Supabase's free tier for our initial implementation, we need a robust testing strategy that accounts for potential service limitations or disruptions.

## Row-Level Security (RLS) Testing

### Unit Testing RLS Policies

1. **Local Policy Validation**
   - Create PostgreSQL scripts that replicate our RLS policies
   - Run these scripts in a local development PostgreSQL instance
   - Validate policies with different user contexts and expected outcomes
   - Automate these tests to run during CI/CD pipelines

2. **Policy Documentation and Review**
   - Document each RLS policy with:
     - Policy name and purpose
     - SQL implementation
     - Expected behavior for each user role
   - Conduct regular peer reviews of RLS policies
   - Maintain a test matrix for policy combinations

3. **Integration Tests Against Development Database**
   - Create test suite that runs against a development Supabase instance
   - Test each policy with different authenticated users
   - Verify data access restrictions are enforced correctly
   - Include negative test cases to confirm data isolation

4. **Role-Based Access Validation**
   - Create automated tests that attempt to:
     - Read data as different user roles
     - Write data as different user roles
     - Update/delete data as different user roles
   - Verify access patterns match business requirements

## Real-Time Feature Testing

### Mock-Based Testing

1. **Mocked Supabase Client**
   - Create mock implementations of Supabase real-time clients
   - Simulate subscription events and responses
   - Test application behavior with predictable event patterns
   - Validate UI updates in response to simulated events

2. **Subscription Handler Testing**
   - Unit test subscription setup and teardown logic
   - Test error handling for subscription failures
   - Validate reconnection strategies
   - Test subscription filtering logic

### Resilience Testing

1. **Fallback Mechanism Testing**
   - Test polling fallback when real-time connections fail
   - Validate offline mode behavior when disconnected
   - Measure performance impact of fallback mechanisms
   - Test graceful degradation of real-time features

2. **Recovery Testing**
   - Simulate connection interruptions
   - Verify automatic reconnection behavior
   - Test data synchronization after reconnection
   - Validate UI state after recovery

### End-to-End Testing

1. **Controlled Environment Testing**
   - Set up dedicated Supabase project for testing
   - Create automated tests that:
     - Subscribe to real-time channels
     - Make data changes that trigger real-time events
     - Validate that notifications are received
     - Verify latency is within acceptable thresholds

2. **Load Testing Approach**
   - Create simulations with multiple concurrent users
   - Measure real-time event delivery under load
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Establish performance baselines for free tier usage

3. **Service Outage Simulation**
   - Temporarily block connections to Supabase
   - Validate application behavior during outage
   - Test recovery when service becomes available
   - Verify data consistency after outage

## Integration Testing Architecture

### Test Environment

1. **Dedicated Test Project**
   - Create separate Supabase project for testing
   - Reset to known state before test runs
   - Populate with representative test data
   - Configure with identical RLS policies as production

2. **Automated Test Suite**
   - Jest or Vitest for front-end tests
   - xUnit for backend .NET tests
   - Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration

### Test Data Management

1. **Seed Data Scripts**
   - Create PostgreSQL scripts for test data generation
   - Include representative data for all entity types
   - Create data for multiple user contexts
   - Version control these scripts with the application code

2. **Test Data Isolation**
   - Use unique identifiers for test runs
   - Clean up test data after test execution
   - Implement row isolation between test cases
   - Prevent test data from affecting metrics or analytics

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Real-Time Health Checks**
   - Implement regular health checks for Supabase real-time services
   - Monitor subscription success rates
   - Track reconnection events
   - Log latency metrics for real-time updates

2. **Client-Side Telemetry**
   - Track real-time connection status in client
   - Measure event delivery times
   - Record fallback mechanism activations
   - Aggregate metrics in Application Insights

3. **Alerting Strategy**
   - Configure alerts for:
     - Sustained real-time connection failures
     - Elevated latency in event delivery
     - Increased error rates in Supabase operations
     - Abnormal fallback mechanism usage

## Free Tier Considerations

1. **Usage Tracking**
   - Monitor approach to free tier limits
   - Track real-time connection counts
   - Measure database row counts and storage usage
   - Set up alerts for approaching limits

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Implement tiered feature availability
   - Design system to function with delayed updates if real-time is unavailable
   - Cache critical data client-side
   - Prioritize essential real-time features

3. **Upgrade Path Planning**
   - Define thresholds for upgrading to paid tier
   - Document migration process for database and auth
   - Plan for minimal downtime during upgrade
   - Test upgrade procedures in advance

## Periodic Manual Testing

1. **Regular Service Validation**
   - Schedule weekly manual tests of real-time features
   - Verify subscription functionality across devices
   - Test with actual tournament scoring scenarios
   - Document any observed performance issues

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Test real-time features across different browsers
   - Verify mobile browser compatibility
   - Test PWA offline/online transitions
   - Validate WebSocket support across platforms

## Test Documentation

1. **Test Case Library**
   - Maintain comprehensive test cases for:
     - RLS policy validation
     - Real-time subscription scenarios
     - Error and recovery paths
     - Performance benchmarks

2. **Test Results Reporting**
   - Generate reports from automated test runs
   - Track success rates over time
   - Document known issues and workarounds
   - Share insights with development team
