# Feature List and Prioritization

This document outlines the key features of the Golf Tournament Organizer Application, organized by priority and importance.

## Must-Have (Baseline) Features – The Essentials

These are the table-stakes features that every leading app includes and users expect. Without these, the app won't be considered usable for golf rounds:

| Feature | Why It's Essential |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Live Scoring** (solo & group) | Core functionality—track shots in real time; updates visible to all players in the group or event. |
| **Handicap Tracking / Adjustments** | Many users play using handicaps. Automatically apply them during scoring. Ideally link to WHS if possible. |
| **Basic Stats** (putts, GIR, FIR) | Must include tracking for fairways hit, greens in regulation, putts per hole, etc. |
| **Course Database with Auto Setup** | Quickly find and load local courses with pre-filled hole/par data. Support at least 30k+ courses globally. |
| **Multi-Format Support** | Stroke play, Stableford, match play, skins, etc. are common among recreational players. |
| **Shareable Scorecards / Leaderboards** | Export/share final results with friends or social platforms (link, image, or PDF). |
| **Free-to-Use Mode with No Paywall for Basics** | Ensure casual golfers can use it for free—scoring, stats, and sharing at a minimum. |

## High-Value Features – Popular & Differentiating

These are the features that define the top competitors and make apps more sticky, engaging, and worth recommending.

| Feature | Why It's Popular / Important |
|---------|------------------------------|
| **Live Group Leaderboard (Multi-group)** | Show real-time rankings across multiple groups. Vital for mini-events and tournaments. |
| **Social Feed / Timeline** | Like GolfGameBook: users can see what their friends are playing, comment, or react. Builds retention. |
| **Player Profiles & History** | Track stats over time, badge achievements, personal bests. |
| **In-App Messaging / Chat** | Enables group coordination before, during, and after rounds. Popular in apps like Leaderboard Golf. |
| **GPS & Rangefinder** | Even if basic, players expect to see yardages to green, hazards, etc. Huge UX boost. |
| **Photo + Round Story Sharing** | Let users add photos, tag moments, create visual summaries of rounds (like Strava for golf). |
| **Smartwatch Support (optional)** | Used by ~15–20% of golfers; being able to score from a watch is a "wow" feature. |
| **Support for Team Formats** | 2-player teams, 4-ball best ball, etc. for more complex recreational formats. |
| **Game Center (Skins, Nassau, Wolf, etc.)** | Golfers love playing side games; this adds real fun to group rounds. |
| **Offline Scoring Capability** | Courses often have poor coverage—must allow scoring offline, with later sync. |

## Monetizable Premium Features – For Freemium Strategy

These should be non-essential, but valuable enough for power users to pay for:

| Premium Feature | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Advanced Analytics** | Deeper stats: strokes gained, tee-to-green splits, performance by club, trends. |
| **3D Course Maps / Pro View** | Visual enhancements, elevation data, green contours. |
| **Virtual Coach / Tips** | Feedback on performance trends, club suggestions, etc. (like 18Birdies' AI Coach). |
| **Ad-Free Experience** | Always a popular upgrade incentive. |
| **Custom Group Events or Leagues** | Offer branded tournaments, private leaderboards, downloadable results. |
| **Cloud Storage / Archive Access** | Full game history backups, PDF exports, sharing links. |

## Opportunity Areas – Where We Can Excel

These are areas we can excel in that most others only partially implement:

1. **UX & Speed**: Many apps feel clunky or bloated. A fast, intuitive, minimalist UI will win fans (like PlayThru, but better looking).

2. **Localized Community**: Dutch-first or EU-first social features could dominate in your starting region. Golf.nl has users, but no fun or real scoring tools.

3. **Zero-setup Rounds**: Let users start a round and score with minimal setup. AI suggestions (course, format, players) help.

4. **Automatic Group Scoring Sync**: Avoid double data entry; make it automatic.

5. **Easy Link Sharing**: No login needed to view scorecards or follow leaderboards—great for sharing with friends/family.

6. **Real-world Incentives / Partner Ties**: Hook into sponsor challenges or local course leaderboards.

7. **Open Platform for Clubs**: Let local clubs run low-stakes tourneys for free (charge only for premium branding and stats).

## Strategy to Be the Best

To dominate the market:

* **Offer more value in the free tier** than competitors, without overwhelming the user.
* **Nail live scoring + social + stats** as the core trifecta.
* **Build an EU-localized product with clean UX** and an upgrade path for prosumers and clubs.
* **Make it fun**, not just functional: this is a key reason GolfGameBook and Strava succeeded.

## Additional Ideas

- Player and club profiles with links to other sites
- Places for people to show off their ads
- Social challenges like 'most birdies in week X'
