# Feature List and Prioritization

This document outlines the key features of the Golf Tournament Organizer Application, organized by priority and importance using MoSCoW prioritization (Must, Should, Could, Won't).

## Initial Launch Strategy - Exclusive Access

Due to infrastructure optimization and to ensure the highest quality experience, we're implementing a limited access approach for our initial launch:

- **Organizer Accounts**: Limited to the first 100 tournament organizers
- **Player Accounts**: Limited to 900 player accounts

This exclusive "founding members" approach allows us to:
1. Optimize performance with controlled scaling
2. Gather focused feedback from a dedicated user base
3. Create a sense of community among early users
4. Generate urgency and scarcity for marketing purposes

We'll maintain a waitlist for interested organizers and players once these limits are reached, with priority access given to referrals from existing users.

## Must-Have (Baseline) Features – The Essentials

These are the table-stakes features that every leading app includes and users expect. Without these, the app won't be considered usable for golf rounds:

## Opportunity Areas – Where We Can Excel

These are areas we can excel in that most others only partially implement:

1. **UX & Speed**: Many apps feel clunky or bloated. A fast, intuitive, minimalist UI will win fans (like PlayThru, but better looking).

2. **Localized Community**: Dutch-first or EU-first social features could dominate in your starting region. Golf.nl has users, but no fun or real scoring tools.

3. **Multi-Language Support**: Full support for English and Dutch from day one, with community-driven expansion to other languages. See our [Multi-Language Strategy](multi-language-strategy.md).

4. **Zero-setup Rounds**: Let users start a round and score with minimal setup. AI suggestions (course, format, players) help.

4. **Easy Link Sharing**: No login needed to view scorecards or follow leaderboards—great for sharing with friends/family.

5. **Real-world Incentives / Partner Ties**: Hook into sponsor challenges or local course leaderboards.

6. **Open Platform for Clubs**: Let local clubs run low-stakes tourneys for free (charge only for premium branding and stats).

## Phase 1 Focus (Current Development)

Our current development focus is on:

1. **Recording App**: A robust mobile application for entering and tracking scores during play.

2. **Leaderboard Website & PWA**: A responsive web application with:
   - Real-time tournament leaderboard with auto-updates
   - Multi-day tournament support
   - Multiple game mode support
   - Mobile-friendly Progressive Web App implementation

3. **Informational Website**: A simple marketing/information site (potentially integrated with the leaderboard).

4. **Organizer Management Tools**: Basic administrative features for tournament organizers.

## Strategy to Be the Best

To dominate the market:

* **Offer more value in the free tier** than competitors, without overwhelming the user.
* **Nail live scoring + social + stats** as the core trifecta.
* **Build an EU-localized product with clean UX** and an upgrade path for prosumers and clubs.
* **Make it fun**, not just functional: this is a key reason GolfGameBook and Strava succeeded.
* **Prioritize reliability** during critical tournament times.
* **Emphasize offline capabilities** for courses with limited connectivity.

## Planned Caching and Performance Optimization (Future Version)

To ensure scalability and optimal performance as the user base grows, the following caching strategies are planned for future versions of the Golf Tournament Organizer application:

### Redis Caching
- **When to Implement:**
  - Redis caching will be introduced when the application reaches a scale of approximately 50 or more organizations, or when database load/latency becomes a concern.
- **What to Cache:**
  - Forward-viewed data (e.g., upcoming tournaments, schedules, public event data).
  - Organization-shared data that is frequently accessed by multiple users within the same organization.
- **How to Implement:**
  - Integrate Redis as a distributed cache layer in the backend (Azure Functions/.NET 8).
  - Use Redis for caching the results of expensive or frequently repeated queries.
  - Set appropriate cache expiration and invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces load on the PostgreSQL database.
  - Improves response times for high-traffic endpoints.

### Output Caching for Anonymous Data
- **Scope:**
  - Output caching will be applied to all anonymous/public data that is the same for all users, such as leaderboards, tournament results, and public event listings.
- **Strategy:**
  - Cache rendered output or API responses for endpoints serving anonymous data.
  - Use short-to-medium cache durations (e.g., 30 seconds to 5 minutes) depending on the data volatility.
  - Invalidate or refresh the cache when underlying data changes (e.g., new scores submitted).
- **Benefits:**
  - Significantly reduces backend processing for high-traffic, read-heavy endpoints.
  - Ensures fast and consistent user experience for public/unauthenticated users.

### Planned Rate Limiting Strategy

To protect backend resources and ensure fair usage as the platform scales, rate limiting will be implemented as follows:

- **Preferred Approach:**
  - Use a managed API Gateway (e.g., Azure API Management) in front of the backend services (Azure Functions, Supabase, or future containers).
  - API Gateway provides configurable, per-user or per-IP rate limiting, burst control, and analytics with minimal operational overhead.
  - This approach is cloud-native, works with both serverless and containerized deployments, and can be adjusted without code changes.

- **Alternative (if moving to containers):**
  - If the backend is migrated to containers, rate limiting could be enforced at the ingress/load balancer layer (e.g., NGINX, Envoy, Azure Application Gateway).
  - This requires additional configuration and may not offer the same flexibility or observability as a managed API Gateway.

- **Implementation Plan:**
  - Start with API Gateway-based rate limiting for all public and authenticated API endpoints.
  - Define sensible defaults (e.g., X requests per minute per IP/user) and adjust as usage grows.
  - Monitor rate limit metrics and tune policies as needed.
  - Document rate limit policies for API consumers.

- **Rationale:**
  - API Gateway is recommended for its simplicity, flexibility, and integration with cloud monitoring and security features.
  - Load balancer/ingress-based rate limiting is only considered if there are specific container orchestration requirements.

This strategy ensures the platform remains reliable and secure as adoption increases.

### Monitoring and Review
- Regularly monitor cache hit/miss rates and database performance.
- Adjust caching strategies and durations as usage patterns evolve.
- Document cache keys and invalidation logic for maintainability.

These enhancements will be prioritized as the application scales and will be revisited periodically to ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency.
