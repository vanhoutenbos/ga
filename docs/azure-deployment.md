# Azure Deployment Architecture

Building on the lessons learned from previous versions of the application and optimizing for cost-efficiency, the following Azure deployment architecture is recommended:

## Core Infrastructure Components

1. **Frontend Hosting**
   - **Azure Static Web Apps**: For hosting the React SPA frontend
     - Free tier for development, Standard tier for production
     - Built-in GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD
     - Global CDN distribution for performance
     - Managed SSL certificates included

2. **API Services**
   - **Azure Functions (Premium Plan with Elastic Scale)**
     - HTTP-triggered functions for all API endpoints
     - Serverless scaling based on tournament demand
     - Scale to zero during quiet periods
     - Dedicated instances during tournaments for performance
     - VNet integration for enhanced security

3. **Database Services**
   - **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server**
     - Burstable tier for cost optimization
     - Automated backups and point-in-time restore
     - Scheduled scaling for tournament days
   - **Azure Cache for Redis (Basic Tier)**
     - Leaderboard caching and real-time updates
     - Session state management
     - Distributed locking for concurrent edits

4. **Storage Services**
   - **Azure Blob Storage**
     - Tournament media and document storage
     - Static assets for web application
     - Export file generation and storage
     - Hot access tier for active tournaments, Archive tier for historical data
   - **Azure Table Storage**
     - Tournament configuration settings
     - User preferences storage
     - Low-cost, high-scale NoSQL storage

5. **Identity and Security**
   - **Azure Active Directory B2C**
     - User authentication and identity management
     - Social identity providers integration
     - Custom branding for white-labeled instances
     - Progressive profiling for user data collection
   - **Azure Key Vault**
     - Secret management and certificate storage
     - Managed identity access for secure access

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Serverless-First Approach**
   - Azure Functions consumption plan for most workloads
   - Scale to zero during non-tournament periods
   - Premium plan reserved instances only for tournament days
   - Event-driven architecture to minimize idle resources

2. **Multi-Tenancy Efficiency**
   - Shared infrastructure across multiple tournaments
   - Logical isolation with tenant identifiers
   - Database schema designed for multi-tenant efficiency
   - Tenant-specific caching strategies

3. **Automatic Scaling Rules**
   - Schedule-based scaling for known tournament dates
   - Metric-based autoscaling for unexpected traffic
   - Cool-down periods to prevent scaling thrashing
   - Pre-warming functions before tournament start times

4. **Storage Tiering Strategy**
   - Hot storage for active tournaments
   - Cool storage for recent past tournaments
   - Archive storage for historical data
   - Lifecycle management policies for automatic transitions

5. **Regional Deployment Optimization**
   - Primary deployment in region with most users
   - Content distribution via global CDN
   - Geo-replication for disaster recovery
   - Traffic manager for global routing optimization

## DevOps and CI/CD Pipeline

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - Automated builds and testing
   - Environment-specific deployments
   - Infrastructure as Code validation
   - Security scanning and compliance checks

2. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Bicep templates for Azure resources
   - Environment configuration through parameters
   - Reusable modules for common patterns
   - Policy-as-code for governance

3. **Monitoring and Operations**
   - Application Insights for telemetry
   - Log Analytics for centralized logging
   - Azure Monitor alerts for critical issues
   - Custom dashboards for tournament operations

4. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
   - Point-in-time database backups
   - Geo-redundant storage for critical data
   - Automated recovery testing
   - Comprehensive business continuity plan

This architecture provides a balance between cost optimization and performance, with particular attention to the unique demands of golf tournaments where usage spikes during specific events and may remain dormant between tournaments.
