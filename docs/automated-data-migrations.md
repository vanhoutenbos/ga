# Automated Data Migrations

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for handling schema changes and data migrations in the Golf Tournament Organizer application. As the application evolves, database schema changes are inevitable. To maintain data integrity and minimize disruption to users, we have implemented an automated migration strategy that allows for seamless updates to the database schema and data transformations.

## Migration Principles

1. **Zero-downtime migrations** - Database migrations should not cause application downtime
2. **Backward compatibility** - New schema should support existing data and code
3. **Forward compatibility** - Old code should work with new schema where possible
4. **Verification** - All migrations should be tested thoroughly before being applied to production
5. **Rollback capability** - Every migration should have a corresponding rollback plan
6. **Audit trail** - All schema changes must be tracked, versioned, and documented

## Migration Technology Stack

### Supabase Database Migrations

For our Supabase PostgreSQL database, we use a combination of:

1. **Supabase CLI Migrations**: For schema changes that can be expressed in SQL
2. **Custom Migration Framework**: For complex data transformations or multi-step migrations

```bash
# Example of creating a new migration with Supabase CLI
supabase migration new add_handicap_to_players

# Example of applying migrations
supabase db push
```

### Schema Changes in Development

1. **Local Development**:
   - Developers create migrations locally using the Supabase CLI
   - Migrations are tested against local database instances
   - All schema changes must include both "up" and "down" migrations

2. **Migration File Format**:
   - Timestamp-prefixed SQL files (e.g., `20230601120000_add_handicap_to_players.sql`)
   - Clear comments documenting the purpose and impact of the migration
   - Explicit transaction boundaries for atomicity

3. **Migration File Example**:

```sql
-- Migration: add_handicap_to_players
-- Description: Adds handicap field to players table with default value
-- Created by: Jane Developer
-- Date: 2025-04-15

-- Up Migration
BEGIN;

-- Add handicap column with default value of 0
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN handicap NUMERIC(4,1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- Add check constraint to ensure handicap is within valid range (-10 to 54)
ALTER TABLE players ADD CONSTRAINT chk_handicap_range 
    CHECK (handicap >= -10 AND handicap <= 54);

-- Create index for efficient queries by handicap
CREATE INDEX idx_players_handicap ON players(handicap);

COMMIT;

-- Down Migration
BEGIN;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_players_handicap;
ALTER TABLE players DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS chk_handicap_range;
ALTER TABLE players DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS handicap;

COMMIT;
```

### Schema Changes in CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Pull Request Validation**:
   - Automatic validation of migration syntax
   - Schema compatibility checks
   - Test migrations against a clean database instance
   - Test migrations against a database with production-like data

2. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Migrations are applied to staging environment first
   - Integration tests verify application functionality with new schema
   - Performance impact is measured

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Migrations are applied during low-traffic periods when possible
   - Monitoring alerts are configured to detect any issues
   - Rollback plan is prepared and ready to execute if needed

## Complex Data Migrations

For complex data transformations that cannot be expressed in a simple SQL migration, we use a custom migration framework built on Azure Functions:

```csharp
// Example of a complex data migration using our custom framework
[FunctionName("MigratePlayerHandicapCalculation")]
public static async Task RunAsync(
    [TimerTrigger("0 0 2 * * 0")] TimerInfo timer, // Run at 2 AM every Sunday
    [Sql("SELECT * FROM players WHERE last_handicap_update IS NULL", 
         CommandType = CommandType.Text,
         ConnectionStringSetting = "SupabaseConnection")] IEnumerable<Player> playersToMigrate,
    [Sql("SupabaseConnection")] SqlAsyncCollector<PlayerHandicapUpdate> handicapUpdates,
    ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation($"Starting player handicap migration for {playersToMigrate.Count()} players");
    
    foreach (var player in playersToMigrate)
    {
        // Complex handicap calculation logic
        var newHandicap = await CalculatePlayerHandicap(player);
        
        // Update player record
        await handicapUpdates.AddAsync(new PlayerHandicapUpdate
        {
            PlayerId = player.Id,
            Handicap = newHandicap,
            LastUpdate = DateTime.UtcNow
        });
    }
    
    log.LogInformation("Player handicap migration completed successfully");
}
```

## Handling Breaking Changes

When schema changes would break existing client applications:

1. **Schema Versioning**:
   - Critical API endpoints maintain multiple versions
   - Old schema views remain available during transition periods

2. **Feature Flags**:
   - New schema features are protected behind feature flags
   - Gradual rollout to allow client applications to adapt

3. **Client Update Management**:
   - Force client updates when breaking changes are unavoidable
   - In-app notifications about required updates

## Data Migration Testing

All migrations undergo the following tests:

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify data integrity after migration
   - Test application functionality with migrated data

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure migration execution time with production-scale data
   - Verify database performance after migration

3. **Rollback Testing**:
   - Verify rollback migration successfully restores previous state
   - Test application functionality after rollback

4. **Concurrency Testing**:
   - Simulate application load during migration
   - Verify locks and blocking behavior

## Multi-Tenant Migration Strategy

Given our multi-tenant architecture:

1. **Tenant Isolation**:
   - Migrations are applied per tenant when possible
   - Tenant-specific data is migrated independently

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Large tenants are migrated in batches to reduce impact
   - Migration windows are scheduled with tenant administrators

3. **Tenant Verification**:
   - Post-migration verification for each tenant
   - Tenant-specific rollbacks if issues are detected

## Migration Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Real-time Migration Monitoring**:
   - Progress tracking for long-running migrations
   - Performance impact monitoring during migration

2. **Post-Migration Health Checks**:
   - Automated data integrity validation
   - Application functionality verification
   - Performance baseline comparison

3. **Alerting**:
   - Immediate alerts for failed migrations
   - Notification of successful migrations to development team

## Emergency Rollback Procedure

In case of critical migration failures:

1. **Identification**:
   - Monitoring alerts identify migration issues
   - Support team escalates user-reported problems

2. **Assessment**:
   - Determine scope and impact of the issue
   - Decide between fix-forward or rollback

3. **Execution**:
   - If rolling back, execute down migration
   - If fixing forward, apply hotfix migration

4. **Verification**:
   - Confirm system health after rollback or hotfix
   - Notify affected users about resolution

5. **Post-Mortem**:
   - Document failure cause and resolution
   - Update migration testing procedures to prevent recurrence

## Version Control and Documentation

1. **Migration Version Control**:
   - All migrations are versioned in git
   - Clear commit messages describing migration purpose
   - Pull request reviews for all schema changes

2. **Migration Documentation**:
   - Database schema diagrams are updated after migrations
   - Migration history is documented in version-controlled files
   - Breaking changes are highlighted in release notes
