# Integration Strategy

The Golf Tournament Organizer application will operate within a broader ecosystem of golf-related systems and services. This document outlines the integration strategy to ensure the application can connect with external systems while maintaining clear boundaries and sustainable development practices.

## Integration Principles

1. **API-First Design**
   - All core functionality will be accessible via documented APIs
   - Public API surface will be versioned and stability-guaranteed
   - Integration capabilities are prioritized as first-class features

2. **Open Standards**
   - Use established industry standards where available
   - Define clear data interchange formats 
   - Implement standard authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, API keys)

3. **Pluggable Architecture**
   - Adapters for specific integrations outside core codebase
   - Extension points for third-party developers
   - Clear documentation for custom integration development

4. **Security by Design**
   - Fine-grained permissions for API access
   - Audit logging for all integration activities
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Priority Integration Targets

### 1. Handicap Systems

**Integration Goal**: Allow players' official handicaps to be retrieved and applied within tournaments.

**Target Systems**:
- World Handicap System (WHS) via regional golf associations
- USGA GHIN (US)

**Integration Approach**:
- Develop adapters for official handicap APIs where available
- Implement manual verification workflow where APIs unavailable
- Consider partnership agreements with regional handicap authorities

**MVP Strategy**:
- Start with manual handicap entry with verification
- Prioritize development of NGF (Dutch Golf Federation) integration as an example
- Document process for adding additional handicap system integrations

### 2. Golf Course Management Systems

**Integration Goal**: Enable synchronization with course management software for tournament registration, tee times, and results publishing.

**Target Systems**:
- Club Systems (ClubV1, etc.)
- Jonas Club Software
- GolfBox Tournament
- BRS Golf / GolfNow
- GIFS systems

**Integration Approach**:
- Develop export/import capabilities for common formats

### 3. Scoring Input Systems

**Integration Goal**: Allow scores to be entered through third-party systems and devices.

**Target Systems**:
- Golf cart scoring systems
- Golf GPS devices with scoring
- Specialized tournament hardware

**Integration Approach**:

- Create scoring device management interface
- Support bulk score import from CSV/Excel

**MVP Strategy**:
- Implement QR code generation for quick score submission
- Build CSV import for batch scoring
- Document API for third-party score submission

### 4. Social Platforms

**Integration Goal**: Enable sharing of tournament information, results, and player achievements to social media platforms.

**Target Systems**:
- Twitter/X
- Facebook
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- WhatsApp (direct sharing)

**Integration Approach**:
- Implement Share API integration
- Generate shareable graphics for leaderboards and scorecards
- Create customizable sharing templates

**MVP Strategy**:
- Focus on direct sharing via device Share API
- Generate tournament summary images for easy sharing
- Track sharing analytics for future improvements

   - Scheduled automatic exports
   - Customizable data mapping
   - Secure transfer options (HTTPS, SFTP)

## Authentication and Authorization for Integrations

1. **Authentication Options**
   - OAuth 2.0 for user-centric integrations
   - API keys for server-to-server integrations
   - JWT tokens with appropriate scopes
   - IP-based restrictions as additional security

2. **Authorization Model**
   - Fine-grained permissions for API resources
   - Role-based access control for integration partners
   - Resource-level permissions for specific tournaments
   - Audit trails for all integration activities

3. **Partner Management**
