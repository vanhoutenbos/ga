# Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive monitoring and alerting strategy for the Golf Tournament Organizer application. Effective monitoring is critical to ensuring the application's reliability, performance, and security, particularly during active tournaments when real-time functionality and system uptime are essential.

## Monitoring Objectives

Our monitoring strategy aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify potential problems before they impact users
2. **Performance Optimization**: Track performance metrics to guide optimization efforts
3. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource usage trends to anticipate scaling needs
4. **Security Vigilance**: Detect and alert on potential security incidents
5. **User Experience Enhancement**: Correlate technical metrics with user experience
6. **SLA Compliance**: Ensure the application meets defined service level agreements

## Monitoring Architecture

Our monitoring architecture follows a layered approach:
