# Infrastructure and Cost Management Plan

This document outlines our infrastructure and cost management strategy for the Golf Tournament Organizer Application.

## Streamlined Environment Strategy

To optimize development efficiency while keeping costs under control, we're implementing a minimalist environment approach:

### Production Environment

- **Primary Application Deployment**: Our only continuously maintained cloud environment
- **Purpose**: Serves all end-users and contains all live data
- **Infrastructure**: Supabase hosted platform (free tier initially)
- **User Limits**: 100 organizer accounts + 900 player accounts (creating scarcity)
- **Data Management**: Complete backup regime, monitoring, and alerting
- **Cost Optimization**: Scheduled auto-scaling during predictable low-usage periods

### Local Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Individual developer workstations for feature development and testing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-based Supabase local development setup
- **Data**: Sanitized subset of production data for testing
- **Cost**: Zero cloud cost (runs on developer machines)
- **Advantages**: Quick iteration, parallel development, no cloud spend

### Preview/Staging (Temporary When Needed)

- **Purpose**: Pre-release validation of significant changes
- **Implementation**: Uses schema prefixing within production database
- **Lifecycle**: Created for testing → validated → merged to production → removed
- **Cost Control**: Only exists during testing windows, no persistent resources
- **Security**: Limited to internal team access only

## Cost Avoidance Rationale

We're deliberately avoiding typical multi-environment setups that include:

1. **Development Environment**: Replaced by local development
2. **Testing Environment**: Replaced by CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral testing
3. **Persistent Staging**: Replaced by temporary preview slots

This approach eliminates approximately 65-75% of typical infrastructure costs while maintaining development quality and release safety through:

- Strong CI/CD practices with automated testing
- Feature flagging to safely introduce new capabilities
- Canary deployments for gradual production rollouts
- Comprehensive local testing before production deployment

## Infrastructure as Code

All environments will be defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure consistency:

```bash
# Example local environment instantiation
supabase init
supabase start

# Database migrations applied consistently across environments
supabase db push

# Preview environment setup (when needed)
./scripts/create-preview-environment.sh feature-branch-name
```

## Cost-Conscious Feature Development

Feature development priorities will consider infrastructure impact:

1. **Storage-Efficient Media Handling**: Implement image optimization to reduce storage needs
2. **Connection Pooling**: Minimize database connection count to stay within free tier limits
3. **Edge Caching**: Reduce compute needs by aggressively caching static content
4. **Batch Processing**: Group operations to minimize transaction counts

## Scaling Strategy

When user demand exceeds free tier limits, we'll implement a planned scaling approach:

1. **Analyze Usage Patterns**: Determine actual vs. theoretical resource needs
2. **Selective Tier Upgrades**: Upgrade only components reaching limits
3. **Revenue Alignment**: Ensure new paying customers justify infrastructure expansions

By following this approach, we'll maintain maximum development agility while keeping infrastructure costs at or near zero until revenue justifies expansion.
