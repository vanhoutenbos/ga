# Business Model and Open Source Strategy

## Open Source Approach: Open Core Model

After careful analysis of the codebase and project requirements, the recommended approach is an **Open Core Model**:

- **Core Platform (Open Source)**
  - Basic tournament creation and management
  - Standard scoring and leaderboard functionality
  - Player registration system
  - Mobile-responsive web application
  - Basic API integrations
  - License: **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**

- **Premium Extensions (Proprietary)**
  - Advanced analytics and statistics
  - White-label customization for organizations
  - Advanced reporting engines and exports
  - Custom advertisement capabilities
  - Data collection APIs for marketing
  - Communication tools for tournament organizers

## License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)

The MPL-2.0 license provides an optimal balance for this project because:

1. **File-level copyleft** - Modifications to existing files must be shared, encouraging improvements to core functionality
2. **Permissive for new files** - New modules can use different licenses, allowing for proprietary extensions
3. **Compatible with commercial use** - Organizations can use the software in commercial settings
4. **Patent protection** - Includes explicit patent license grants to protect contributors
5. **Modern and well-understood** - Widely recognized license with good community acceptance

This license prevents competitors from creating closed-source forks of core functionality while allowing the creation of proprietary extensions for monetization.

## Business Model: SaaS with Tiered Pricing

```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Initial Repository Setup**
   - Create public GitHub repository with MPL-2.0 license
   - Implement core domain models based on existing codebase
   - Establish extension points for future premium features
   - Set up comprehensive documentation

2. **Community Building**
   - Create detailed contribution guidelines
   - Implement automated testing to maintain quality
   - Set up project website with clear value proposition
   - Establish community communication channels (Discord, discussions)

3. **Premium Feature Development**
   - Develop premium features in private repository
   - Implement subscription management system
   - Create deployment pipeline for hosted version
   - Establish customer support processes

4. **Continuous Evolution**
   - Regular community engagement and contribution review
   - Quarterly roadmap updates based on feedback

## Launch Strategy

To acquire the first 100-500 users, focus on:

- Email pitch to tournament organizers (offer free branded scoring + leaderboard)
- Reddit / Facebook groups
- Referral reward for sharing scorecards
