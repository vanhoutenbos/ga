Data Migration & Backup Strategy

Your backup strategy starts with an SQL approach, but implementation details are light
How frequently will backups run?
How will you test restore procedures?
What's the retention policy for backups?

CI/CD for Database Changes

How will database schema changes be managed in your CI/CD pipeline?
Strategy for handling breaking schema changes
Edge Functions Usage

You mention Supabase Edge Functions but don't detail specific use cases
Which operations will be implemented as Edge Functions versus in your Azure Functions?

Azure Functions Details: 
How will your Azure Functions (.NET 8) integrate with Supabase? 
What caching strategies will you implement at the API level when you scale up?

Questions for Clarification



Disaster Recovery Testing: While you cover extensive performance and load testing, I don't see specific scenarios for disaster recovery testing. How would your application recover if Supabase were to experience extended downtime?

Compliance and Data Residency: For applications with users in different geographical regions, how are you handling data residency requirements and compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA?

Upgrade Planning: Supabase regularly releases new versions with breaking changes. Do you have a strategy for testing and upgrading when new Supabase versions are released?

Cross-Browser/Device Testing: While you have extensive backend testing, how are you validating that the Supabase realtime features work consistently across different browsers and devices?

Cost Projection: You mention free tier constraints frequently, but do you have a model for projecting costs if you were to exceed free tier limits? How would costs scale with your current architecture?

1. CI/CD Pipeline
I don't see detailed documentation about your CI/CD pipeline strategy. While you have an Azure pipeline reference in the old codebase, a modern CI/CD approach for the new stack would be beneficial.

Question: Have you established a CI/CD pipeline for your new architecture with .NET 8 and React? If so, could you describe it or where it's documented?

2. API Versioning Strategy
API versioning is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility as your application evolves.

Question: Do you have a documented strategy for API versioning and backward compatibility, especially for tournament data which might need to evolve over time?

3. Performance Testing for Azure Functions
While you have documentation on Azure Functions performance optimization and Supabase load testing, I don't see specific performance testing methodologies for your Azure Functions.

Question: Have you documented specific performance testing approaches for your Azure Functions, especially under varying loads during tournaments?

4. Access Control Implementation Details
I see you're using Supabase Row-Level Security, but I'm curious about the specific implementation details.

Question: Could you elaborate on how you're implementing role-based access control across different levels of tournaments (organizers, players, spectators) using Supabase RLS policies?

5. Disaster Recovery and Backup Strategy
While there's extensive documentation on monitoring, I don't see explicit disaster recovery procedures.

Question: What is your backup and restore strategy for both Supabase data and any other persistent storage you're using?

6. Client-Side State Management
With real-time features, offline capabilities, and multi-user editing, state management becomes complex.

Question: Which state management approach are you using in your React frontend (Redux, Context API, React Query, etc.), and how does it handle syncing with Supabase real-time updates?

7. DevOps Environment Separation
Your cost plans mention different environments, but I don't see explicit documentation on environment separation.

Question: How are you separating your development, staging, and production environments, particularly for Supabase resources?

8. Security and Compliance Documentation
Given golf tournaments may involve payments and personal information, security documentation is important.

Question: Do you have documentation on security measures, data protection compliance, and audit logs, especially for any potential payment processing?

9. API Documentation and OpenAPI/Swagger Integration
I don't see explicit API documentation strategy for your backend APIs.

Question: Are you using OpenAPI/Swagger or another approach to document your APIs for both internal and potential third-party integrations?

10. Supabase Limits & Migration: Is your migration plan for outgrowing Supabaseâ€™s free/pro tiers (e.g., moving to self-hosted Postgres) fully documented and tested?

11. Mobile UX Edge Cases: How will you handle device/browser-specific quirks, especially for offline and PWA installability?

12. Real-Time Scaling: How will you handle real-time updates at scale (e.g., 1000+ concurrent users in a tournament)?

13. Monitoring & Alerting: Are your monitoring/alerting strategies for both frontend and backend (App Insights, logs, errors) fully automated and actionable?

14. Security Audits: Have you planned for regular security reviews, dependency scanning, and penetration testing?

15. Accessibility: Is there a plan for full accessibility (WCAG) compliance, especially for public-facing features?

16. User Support & Feedback: How will you collect and act on user feedback post-launch?

17. Documentation for Contributors: Is there a clear onboarding guide for new developers/contributors?

18. API Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention: How will you prevent API abuse, especially for public endpoints?

19. Multi-Tenancy Isolation: Are there tests and guarantees for strict tenant data isolation at all layers?

20. Automated Data Migrations: How will you handle schema changes and data migrations in production?
